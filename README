ABOUT:
This script pardons a banned user on a minecraft server for a specified time and then bans them again.
It is intended to be used for time management, as it's way too easy to accidentally play for too long.
For this to work, Minecraft needs to be run in screen like so:
screen -S MinecraftServer -c MINECRAFTDIR/screenrc java -Xmx200M -Xms200M -jar MINECRAFTDIR/minecraft_server.jar nogui
